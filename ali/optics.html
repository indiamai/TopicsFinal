          The way Fourier optics work is quite different than ordinary ray optics. A lot of us will have
          came across ray optics whilst we were at school, or maybe university. The reason for this is that
          ray optics is fairly simple to understand and visualise, this makes it perfect for giving us a grounding
          of how common light-based phenomena arise, such as refraction. However, ray theory does not describe
          phenomena such as interference and diffraction, so we need a new way of looking at these problems.
          The reason for this is that ray optics use approximate solutions to
          <a href="maxwell.html"><u>Maxwell's equations.</u></a>
          These solutions are only valid when the light waves interact
          with objects whose dimensions are much larger than the wavelength of the light. To try and give us a
          more generalised understanding of a huge variety of optical phenomena, we see the optical field as an
          exact solution to
          <span title="see above">Maxwell's equations.</span>
          This more general way of thinking about wave optics can accurately explain the operation of
          Fourier optics devices.

        <p id="main-body-fourieroptics" class="text-body text">
          Fourier optics is a way of studying classical optics using the
          <a href="fourier.html"><u>Fourier transform</u></a>. Based on diffraction theory and the propagation of
          light, Fourier optics is a powerful tool that uses the Fourier transform to calculate properties of
          light.

        <p id="main-body-scalardiffraction" class="text-body text">
          The study of diffraction, and propagation, of electromagnetic fields has a long history
          of development and there are a vast number of subtleties that need to be considered carefully
          to produce consistent and accurate results. In a lens with constant refractive index, or
          a medium like free space,

          described by a scalar function representing either the electric or the magnetic 
          field amplitude.
