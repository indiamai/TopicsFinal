            The Fourier series acts to represent funtions as the sum of simple sine waves. This is the main
            concept of the Fourier transform which is discussed slightly further down this web page.
            <br>
            A Fourier series is an expansion of a periodic function in terms of an infinite sum of sines and cosines. In the
            context that we will be looking at this later that means an electromagnetic wave. The study of Fourier series
            is known as
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_analysis">harmonic analysis</a>
            and is extremely useful as a way to break up and simplify any periodic function into a set of terms that can be
            substituted in, solved individually, and then recombined to obtain the solution to the original problem.
            <br>
            A general <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FourierSeries.html"><u>Fourier Series</u></a> of a function
            $f(x)$, is defined (on the interval $[-\pi,\pi]$) as follows:
            <br>
            $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_ncos(nx) + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_nsin(nx)$
            <br> where:
            <br>
            $a_0 = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)dx$ <br>
            $a_n = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}cos(nx)dx$ <br>
            $b_n = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}sin(nx)dx$ <br>

          <h2 id="main-body-transform" class="text-body text">Fourier Tranform - The Idea</h2>
          <p id="main-body-fouriertransform" class="text-body text">
            The Fourier transform of a function of time is a complex-valued function of frequency,
             whose absolute value represents the amount of that frequency present in the original function,
              and whose complex argument is the phase offset of the basic
              <span title="A  curve similar to the sine function but possibly shifted in phase, period, amplitude, or any combination thereof.">
                <u>sinusoid</u></span> in that frequency.
              <br>
              <br>
              The above definition may sound complicated, but the Fourier transform really does a very intuitive thing.
              <br>
              What the above means, is that the Fourier transform takes a time-based pattern,
              measures every possible cycle and decomposes it into the frequencies that combine to make it.
              Essentially, we are turning a signal into a set of circular paths at every point in time in the
              signal. If we can understand all these circular paths, then we can understand the signal.
              <br>
              It’s like filtering a soup to find out what it’s made from. Use a set of filters to
               find out the different ingredients. This essentially gives you a “recipe” for the soup.
                Recipes are often easier to understand than the soup. If you want the smoothie back, you
               can just follow the recipe.
              <br> The Fourier Transform finds the recipe for a signal, like our soup process: <br>
              •	Start with a time-based signal <br>
              •	Apply filters to measure each possible "circular ingredient" <br>
              •	Collect the full recipe, listing the amount of each "circular ingredient" <br>

          <p id="main-body-fouriermaths" class="text-body text">
            The fourier transform is usually denoted $\hat{f}$. There are a few definitions but the most common is defined
            below of an integratble function $f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$
            The transform is a generalization of the complex Fourier series, seen
            <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FourierSeries.html"><u>here</u></a> <i>(and shown generally above)</i>, 
            in the limit as $L\rightarrow\infty$. Replace the discrete $A_n$ with the continuous $f(x)dx$ while letting
            $\frac{n}{L}\rightarrow x$. Then the sum is changed to an integral, and the tranform is defined as:
            <br>
            $\hat{f}(\xi)= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)e^{2\pi ix\xi}dx$,
            <br>
            For any $\xi\in\mathbb{R}$. Where the $x$ represents time, the transform variable $\xi$ represents frequency.
